"""Single-job tailoring pipeline.

The ``jobapply tailor`` command exists for the case where the user already
knows which role they want to apply to and just hands us the job
description. We skip the search / dedupe / ledger machinery used by
``jobapply run`` and execute the resume + cover-letter agents inline,
plus an optional email drafter for users who want a ready-to-paste
application email.

The output layout mirrors the per-job folder produced by ``jobapply run``
so downstream tooling (PDF backends, Sheets export, etc.) can read it
the same way.
