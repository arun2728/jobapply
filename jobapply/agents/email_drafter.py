"""Email-drafting agent for the ``jobapply tailor`` flow.

Given the tailored resume + cover letter the user is about to send, this
agent produces a short, ready-to-paste application email — subject line
plus body — addressed to a specific recruiter or hiring-manager email
address. Optional ``additional_info`` from the user (e.g. "I met you at
PyCon", "referred by Jane", "available to start in two weeks") is folded
into the prompt so the draft sounds personal rather than generic.
