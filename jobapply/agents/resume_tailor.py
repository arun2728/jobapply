"""Resume tailoring agent.

Historically this module asked the LLM to produce an entire
:class:`TailoredResume` — including the candidate's contact info,
education metadata, employer names, role titles, dates, GPAs and
school locations. That worked when we used premium frontier models
that strictly honour structured-output schemas, but on
OpenAI-compatible open-weights endpoints (Cloudflare Workers AI,
OpenRouter free tiers, …) the model regularly:

* hallucinated employer / school names that aren't in the profile,
* rewrote dates ("Mar 2025 – Present" → "March 2025 to Now"),
* dropped or merged "less relevant" experience rows,
* invented GPAs / coursework / locations,
* mangled the contact line (URLs shortened, phone numbers reformatted).

None of those rewrites help the candidate — the data is already
authoritative in :class:`Profile`. So this module now follows a
*deterministic where possible, AI where helpful* strategy:

* Contact info, education entries, employer / role / dates and project
  names / descriptions are copied verbatim from the profile.
* The LLM only produces a small structured payload with the parts
  that actually benefit from JD-aware rewriting: the summary, the
  skill ordering, and one rewritten bullet list per experience role
  (and per project, when the profile has projects).

The output schema for the LLM (:class:`_TailoredBullets`) is private
to this module — callers still receive a :class:`TailoredResume`
assembled deterministically from the profile + LLM bullets.

The legacy "ask the LLM for the whole TailoredResume" path is kept
for callers that don't pass a structured ``profile`` (a handful of
older tests). Real production callers — :func:`tailor_for_job_description`
and the LangGraph node — always pass one.
