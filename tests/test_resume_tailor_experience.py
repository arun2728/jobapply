"""Resume-tailor must derive experience + projects deterministically from
the profile and only let the LLM rewrite bullets.

These tests pin three guarantees that matter in production:

* Employer / role / date metadata always comes from the profile —
  never the LLM — so we cannot fabricate or reformat work history.
* When the LLM does provide rewritten bullets per role, they are
  paired by index to the source profile order.
* When the LLM omits a role's bullets (smaller / free-tier models
  often return shorter lists than asked), the corresponding row
  falls back to the profile's verbatim bullets so the candidate's
  history is never lost.
